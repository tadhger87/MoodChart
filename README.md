# MoodChart
for tracking your daily mood

An Android application which allows the user to keep track of how they're feeling over a period of time.  The user is 
prompted to select their mood from a list of options on a daily basis.  That information is collated in graph form to 
provide a visual representation of their mood, on a day to day, week to week or longer period of time.
